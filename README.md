----



This assignment consisted in the construction/drawing of a **Solar System**.

With this we were to get a better understanding of how our computers are able to draw complex shapes onto the screen and all the process behind it, as well learning the concepts surrounding it such as **World/Camera Spaces**, **Geometric Transformations** and **Polynomial Curves/Patches**.

We also refined our knowledge about C++ and used for the first time the library **tinyxml** to parse a **xml** file which contained the details about the **scene** we intended to draw.
